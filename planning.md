## Understanding
I think,  the SPEED variable is constant and used for giving the constant pace for the sprites. PLAYER_SIZE & TREASURE_SIZE = {8,8} is being used to set how big/small creator wants the gaming elements to be. By using bn::display::height() & bn::display::width(), creator set the display size where the treasure will always be displayed. Currently there is no score limitation, player can make as many as score they want. For the score, creator set a specific place (70, -70) which is top right corner. Also for counting scores creator used a for loop.
