## Brainstorming game ideas
I'm thinking add a boost count that will display the number of boost we have
prob gonna be st like 3. // 2 // 1 // 0
How about the screen shake when using boost  // not work! so hard
make the player blink when using boost?


Change the player sprite color (or palette) while boosted
Add a faster speed when going vertical. 
Even adding another sprite that is against the player, maybe slows the character down?



## Plan for implementing game
boost count + blink when using boost
- show 3 begining. maybe top left? or top right hmm.
- go down 1 for each time using A
- show 0 when out
- player blink when usingboost

change sprite to orange when boosted
add another sprite that slows character down, maybe color blue?
try to see if i can add faster speed.


-------- 
I still wanna try the shaking when boost but I may do it afterward since I need to do some homework, so ... to be continue
