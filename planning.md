## Understanding

The first part of the code is defining variables such as speed, character and treasure size, and window dimensions, as well as the location of the score and maximum characters. In the while loop, it defines controls, intersection logic, and score updates. - Seadrah

Game does stuff!

## Planning required changes
background color should be different

 Make it so when player hits start, game restarts -- can be implemented with an "if" check for the start button. I can also change the speed of the character. - Seadrah

## Brainstorming game ideas
should add a sprite wall that kills user

## Plan for implementing game
Aaron shouldnt do anything cause he is awesome
