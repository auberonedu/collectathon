## Understanding
we're moving at 1px per frame

 - Speed is a fixed value set my a static variable.
 - The size of the player and "treasure" are statically set as well.
 - X and Y systems are established by dividing the height and width of the screen, allowing us to have an origin!
 - player_rect and treasure_rect are hitboxes.
 - The location that the treasure can spawn has its RNG bounded by the X/Y boundings.
 
There are player and treasuze sizes 

If highest score reaches more than 11 characters it'll stop.

The square and dot spawn at the same location for the first time.

## Planning required changes

Change Player and treasure sprites and also add a timer

## Brainstorming game ideas

Put obsatcles in the game 

## Plan for implementing game

Kevin will modify sprites using Sprite Editor and I will add custom sound effects when collecting treasure.
