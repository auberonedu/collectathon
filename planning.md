## Understanding
The player moves when the keypad buttons are held based on a set Speed. The bounding boxes of the player/treasure are created through a bn::rect namespace. The collision box is positioned at the sprite's x and y, the size is total, i.e. half in either direction. The player_rect and treasure_rect are defined in update, meaning they will be lost the next frame and disappear. I'm confused by this as I'd assume this would cause a memory leak?
When the player's bounding box intersects with the treasure's, the score increases and the treasure moves to a random position.
A string sprite, made through a sprite_text_generator, displays the current score. This needs to be removed and remade each frame. - Jamison

The first part of the code is defining variables such as speed, character and treasure size, and window dimensions, as well as the location of the score and maximum characters. In the while loop, it defines controls, intersection logic, and score updates. - Seadrah

Game does stuff!

## Planning required changes
Change the speed of the player - Seadrah
Change the backdrop color - Jamison
Change the starting position of the player and dot, making new static constexpr for starting X and Y of each - Aaron
Make it so when the player hits start, the game restarts (the player and treasure are sent back to their initial positions and the score is reset to zero) - Seadrah
Make it so that the player loops around the screen (if they go off the left of the screen, they show up on the right, if they go off the bottom of the screen they show up at the top, etc.) - Aaron
Make a speed boost. When the player presses 'A', their speed is increased for a short amount of time. They can only use the speed boost 3 times. They get all speed boosts back when the game is restarted by pressing start. - Jamison

 Make it so when player hits start, game restarts -- can be implemented with an "if" check for the start button. I can also change the speed of the character. - Seadrah

## Brainstorming game ideas
should add a sprite wall that kills user

## Plan for implementing game
Aaron shouldnt do anything cause he is awesome
