## Understanding
The player moves when the keypad buttons are held based on a set Speed. The bounding boxes of the player/treasure are created through a bn::rect namespace. The collision box is positioned at the sprite's x and y, the size is total, i.e. half in either direction. The player_rect and treasure_rect are defined in update, meaning they will be lost the next frame and disappear. I'm confused by this as I'd assume this would cause a memory leak?
When the player's bounding box intersects with the treasure's, the score increases and the treasure moves to a random position.
A string sprite, made through a sprite_text_generator, displays the current score. This needs to be removed and remade each frame. - Jamison

The first part of the code is defining variables such as speed, character and treasure size, and window dimensions, as well as the location of the score and maximum characters. In the while loop, it defines controls, intersection logic, and score updates. - Seadrah

Game does stuff!

## Planning required changes
background color should be different

 Make it so when player hits start, game restarts -- can be implemented with an "if" check for the start button. I can also change the speed of the character. - Seadrah

## Brainstorming game ideas
should add a sprite wall that kills user

## Plan for implementing game
Aaron shouldnt do anything cause he is awesome
