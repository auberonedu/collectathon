## Understanding

Speed is added or subtracted on a selected axies when buttons are pressed.

Things I see:

set speeds and sizes

size of the screen

where the score location is placed

player controls

## Planning required changes

Change the players speed to a higher number

Change the backdrop color to red

Change the player starting position
    -create/change static contexpr

When player hits start the game should restart
    -add with in the while true loop

Make it when the player loop around the screen it
    -when the playr is in a certain y or x position telerport it to the same position but +/-

Make a speed boost
    -change the speed for 3 seconds then change it back
