# How to play the game?
- It's simple. Get the treasure as many times before the timer runs out. However, a dragon is guarding the treasure and will follow you. Also, there may be a treasure chest that doesn't give points, but rather slow down the player.
- Fun fact: You can use boost to move faster but for what cost? "sike"
